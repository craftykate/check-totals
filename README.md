# Ruby Check Totaling Program

## Overview

* **Who would use it**
	- At my office job I often have several checks to process and total up, and a regular calculator always leaves me a little concerned I didn't count every check or maybe I entered one of them incorrectly. A regular calculator just gives the total, and no more information. So I built this program as a sort of extension to a regular calculator. 
	
* **What it does**
	- This is a basic program that totals checks. That's about it. Keep entering check amounts and it gives you each check's amount, how many checks you've entered, and the total. 
	- Did you enter all 12 checks or just 11? Was the third check you entered correct? Each time you enter a check you will see all the information entered, helping you make sure you've done it correctly.
	- Made a mistake? Type `-2` to erase the second check and a new summary will automatically show up.
